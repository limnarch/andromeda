NAME
    swapon -- list or set swapfiles

SYNOPSIS
    swapon [path minsize maxsize priority]

DESCRIPTION
    swapon creates a new swapfile. The provided path is always absolute, meaning
    it will always be interpreted relative to the root directory. The swapfile
    will begin at minsize and may grow up to maxsize over time as the system
    consumes more virtual memory commitment. Swapfiles are filled from the
    lowest-numbered priority upwards, and all swapfiles of a given priority must
    be completely full before the next priority will see any I/O.

    If no arguments are specified, a list of the currently set swapfiles will be
    printed.
