NAME
    SystemInit -- system initialization program

SYNOPSIS
    SystemInit

DESCRIPTION
    SystemInit is the first program that the kernel runs. It establishes:

  1) The system console device.
  2) The default swapfiles.
  3) The managed device lines.

    To establish the system console device, SystemInit attempts to open several
    devices in sequence, in the order of :ttyV0, :ttyS0, and finally :ttyS1. The
    first that succeeds is set as the system console.

    The latter two things are established at the direction of a configuration
    file which is located at /mintia/SystemInit.cfg. An example of the contents
    of this configuration file is as follows:

                        @SwapFile
                        name='/mintia/SwapFile.sys'
                        minsize='0x400000' #4MB
                        maxsize='0xC00000' #12MB
                        priority='0'

                        @DeviceManagers
                        :ttyV0='/mintia/launchtty.exe'
                        :ttyS0='/mintia/launchtty.exe'
                        :ttyS1='/mintia/launchtty.exe'

    Each @SwapFile section defines a default swapfile that will be created at
    boot time. The swapfile parameters function the same as thoise specified in
    a (1)swapon command line.

    Each key in the @DeviceManagers section defines a managed device line. The
    key is the name of the managed device, and the value is the path to the
    program that will be used to manage it.
