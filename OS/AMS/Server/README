This is a very simple implementation of the Authority Management Server (AMS)
for MINTIA. This only has the capacity to interface with a local "database" of
users and groups, but the interface is supposed to allow a future networked single
sign-on system mediated locally by this server. This implementation should not be
taken as authoritative on the future workings of the AMS and is a placeholder.
