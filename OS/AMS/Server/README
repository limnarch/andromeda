This is a very simple implementation of the Authority Management Server (AMS)
for MINTIA. This version only has the capacity to deal with a local "database" of
users and groups, but the IPC interface is supposed to allow a future networked
sign-on system mediated locally by this server. This implementation should not be
taken as authoritative on the future workings of the AMS and is a placeholder.
