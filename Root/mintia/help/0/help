[7m                     MINTIA Operating System: In-band Manual                   [m

PREFACE
    This manual provides users of the MINTIA operating system with detailed
    information on the system, including its commands and services, along with
    general trivia that may aid in managing the system.  This manual is
    organized into chapters and topics and is accessed by way of the "help"
    command.

    By specifying no arguments on the command line, "help" will display this
    page.  If one argument is given, "help" will interpret it as a topic name,
    and will search the chapters in numerical order to find and display the page
    for that topic.  If two arguments are provided, "help" will treat the first
    one as a chapter number and attempt to look up the topic in that particular
    chapter.


INTRODUCTION
    The MINTIA operating system provides an environment suitable for use in a
    range of systems, from single-user desktop workstations to minicomputers
    supporting dozens of concurrent users.  It does this while retaining
    performance and reliability thanks to the following non-exhaustive list of
    features:

   -> Preemptive event-based priority scheduling.
   -> Dynamically-linked kernel modules.
   -> An extensive system of resource limits.
   -> An object manager for centralized resource tracking and IPC.
   -> File caching that can take advantage of all installed memory.
   -> Demand paging, swapping and working set management.
   -> Userspace shared executables and dynamic linking.
   -> Multi-user object and file security.
   -> Memory-mapped files.
